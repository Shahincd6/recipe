    <p>French fries are a beloved classic, known for their crispy exterior <br> and fluffy interior. Making them at home is easier than you might think!</p>
    <h2>French Fries Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make French Fries:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the Potatoes:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Begin by peeling the potatoes. You can leave the skin on for a more rustic texture if you prefer.</li>
                <li>Cut the potatoes into even-sized matchsticks or strips. Try to make them as uniform in size as possible to ensure even cooking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rinse and Soak:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the potato strips in a large bowl of cold water. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the fries from sticking together during frying.</li>
                <li>Allow the potatoes to soak for at least 30 minutes, or up to a few hours for best results.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Dry:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Drain the soaked potatoes and pat them dry thoroughly using a kitchen towel or paper towels. Removing excess moisture is crucial for crispy fries.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oil:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Pour vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed pot or a deep fryer. You'll need enough oil to submerge the fries completely. Heat the oil to 350-375°F (175-190°C).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Fries:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully add a handful of the dried potato strips to the hot oil. Be cautious to avoid overcrowding the pot, as it can cause the temperature to drop and result in soggy fries.</li>
                <li>Fry the potatoes in batches for about 3-4 minutes or until they turn golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon or a wire mesh skimmer to remove the fries from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
                <li>Repeat this process with the remaining batches of potatoes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Season and Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>While the fries are still hot, season them generously with salt. You can also experiment with other seasonings like garlic powder, paprika, or cayenne pepper for added flavor.</li>
                <li>Serve the hot and crispy homemade French fries immediately with your favorite dipping sauces, such as ketchup, mayo, or aioli.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your delicious homemade French fries! <br>They're perfect as a snack or a side dish for burgers, sandwiches, or other favorite meals.</p>
