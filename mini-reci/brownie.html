    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (or milk chocolate chips if you prefer)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped nuts (optional, such as walnuts or pecans)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Melt the Butter and Chocolate:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler, melt the butter and 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips until smooth. Stir occasionally to combine.</li>
                <li>Once melted, remove from heat and allow it to cool slightly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sift Dry Ingredients:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a separate bowl, sift together the cocoa powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. This helps remove any lumps and ensures even mixing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mix Wet Ingredients:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Gradually add the melted chocolate and butter mixture to the egg and sugar mixture. Stir until smooth and well combined.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Chocolate Chips and Nuts (Optional):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Gently fold in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips (or milk chocolate chips) and chopped nuts, if using. This will create a rich and chunky cookie dough.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough (Optional):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>For thicker cookies, you can chill the dough in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Chilling the dough can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much during baking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Form Cookie Dough Balls:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between each cookie.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. Be careful not to overbake to keep the cookies fudgy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Once cooled, your chocolate chip brownie cookies are ready to enjoy! Serve with a glass of milk for an extra treat.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>These cookies are a delightful combination of brownie and chocolate chip cookie flavors. Enjoy them as a sweet snack or dessert.</p>
